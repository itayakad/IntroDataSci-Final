        "### Intro\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, we selected the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset is widely recognized in the medical and machine learning communities for benchmarking heart disease prediction models. It contains 303 patient records, each with 13 features related to cardiovascular health (e.g., age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced angina), and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "We chose this dataset for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Clinical Relevance:** The features are medically interpretable and commonly collected during routine cardiovascular screenings, making the dataset ideal for developing models that can support real-world clinical decision-making.\n",
        "- **Structured Format:** The dataset is well-structured and manageable in size, allowing for meaningful exploration, visualization, and modeling within the scope of this course.\n",
        "- **Binary Classification Feasibility:** While the original target variable is multiclass (0â€“4), it is commonly simplified to binary classification (presence vs. absence of disease), aligning with our goal to build an interpretable and practical diagnostic tool.\n",
        "- **Benchmarkability:** The dataset has been used in numerous academic papers and projects, providing a clear reference point for comparing the effectiveness of various modeling approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its utility, we acknowledge that the dataset has limitations, including a relatively small sample size and potential class imbalance. These factors were taken into account during model selection, evaluation, and validation strategies (e.g., stratified sampling, cross-validation). Future iterations of this project would benefit from incorporating larger, more diverse datasets to improve generalizability.\n"

        "\n",
        "We chose to scale the continuous features using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to model training, particularly for models sensitive to feature magnitudes such as Logistic Regression. Categorical features (e.g., chest pain type, thalassemia) were encoded using one-hot encoding to maintain interpretability and avoid imposing ordinal relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset was split using an 80/20 ratio to ensure a fair evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities. While the dataset size is limited (303 samples), we chose stratified splitting to preserve class balance across training and testing sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also considered outlier detection but opted not to remove any data points due to the small dataset size and risk of overfitting.\n"

        "The correlation matrix and pairwise feature plots revealed some moderately correlated features. For example, `cp` (chest pain type) and `target` showed a notable relationship, suggesting chest pain type is predictive of heart disease. Similarly, `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) was inversely related to heart disease presence, aligning with clinical intuition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some features such as `fbs` (fasting blood sugar) and `restecg` appeared weakly correlated with the target, which may reduce their influence in tree-based models. However, we retained all features initially to let the models determine importance via feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "One challenge during EDA was the limited size and slightly imbalanced target distribution. While no major skew was found, we remained cautious of overfitting and planned to address this using cross-validation and model regularization.\n"

This is particularly problematic in clinical settings where missing a diagnosis can have serious consequences.\n",

These findings also align with domain knowledge, lending credibility to the model's internal logic.\n",
